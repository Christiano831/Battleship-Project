## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

This project was assigned to us to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript combined. It really focused on using the DOM and making the webpage interactive. Therefore a game was a good project to be assigned. It was my first time making a game and actually using Javascript. I have seen and used a small amount of HTML and CSS before but not as much as in this project. The biggest challenge I faced was when getting event listeners on a specific turn for a button when pressed. Either a button would stop working or the Computer would keep making a move nonstop in the game. I managed to figure out how to make a better loop and stopping at the right time each turn.

## Optimizations

The game originally had the computer make random moves whenever it was its turn. I made a small AI function for the computer to read through the all the buttons on the player's side. If a button came up as a hit piece it would check the piece above it and check to see if it was a piece it can hit. If it wasn't it would check to the right, and then to the bottom, and then to the left. If all sides were unable to be hit, it would give the button a class that would be skipped the next time the AI read the whole code again. This small AI makes it so that all boats will have all the surrouning blocks "clicked" before it went to random choices again.

## Next Steps

- Responsive design

- Boat destroyed notification

- Delay enemy click to show what slot gets chosen

## Pseudocode

HTML will have the intro message to the game with the rules and the grid of the battleship game. The grid of the battleship map will have multiple buttons that will be disabled.

JavaScript will allow the user to click on a play button on the screen and update the HTML to prompt the user to place ships on the grid. 

The player will be allowed to click buttons on the bottom half of the map. The buttons that they press will dictate where their ships will be placed. If a button is clicked, then the button will be updated as a special button for the future of the game. 

Once the player is ready with their ships, they can press the start button. The game begins when the player clicks start and they can now click on the top half of the map. 

When the player clicks on a button, it will disable the button and the computer will automatically press a button on the playerâ€™s side. If the button pressed is a special button(ship) then the player or computer will get to press again. 

The very first move the computer makes will be a random decision. It will continue to be random until it hits a special button. If the computer presses a special button, then it will attempt to press a button next to the available button. The computer will attempt to click every single button surrounding a special button. If all buttons surrounding the special buttons are clicked, then the computer will go back to choosing a random button. This means that if the player decides to place all ships together, they will lose very fast. 

When all special buttons have been pressed on either side, then the game will end and declare the player as the winner or loser. A button will appear to play again. The button will refresh the page when clicked.
